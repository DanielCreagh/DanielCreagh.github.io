# Poster Board Quit Unexpectedly
Received this error when building and running an app in Xcode 14.0 beta 6:

![PosterBoardQuitUnexpectedly](/images/PosterBoardQuitUnexpectedly.png)

Reddit is suggesting that this is a new app `Poster Board` which is used (by developers I assume) to debug and configure the new widgets and home screen for iOS 16.

Hopefully this will be resolved in the upcoming releases of Xcode.
