This seems to be the main crux of the video:
```
Thanks to the Layout protocol, this is no longer the only way we can find out the size of a view â€” we can wrap the view in a custom layout that logs its calls. We write the LogSizes layout, in which we assert that there's just one subview, and we forward the method calls to sizeThatFits and placeSubviews to that subview, without modifying any of the parameters
```
