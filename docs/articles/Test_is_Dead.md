# Old Testament
- The Requirements Document
- Top Down structure
- Pert Chart
- In House QA
* Silo'd

# Waterfall Model
-WaterFail

# New Testament
- Launch software before it's ready
- Devs took responsibility for testing

# Is this just agile? 
> No.

Post Agile, testing takes a back seat. Fr-Agile.

# Building the right IT vs. Building it right.

Speed vs. Quality

People are no longer interested in bugs
Idea Bugs are higher priority

> Every idea can be a winner.
Most ideas fail.

# Pretotyping (pretendotype)
- Testing as soon as possible to ensure you're building the right IT
- different from prototyping, prototyping are POC for the tech

# Lean Startup
- MVP is kind of a prototype/pretotype

# Modern Testing
- Recruitment is down
- Test leaders are fewer and fewer
- Startups not interested in QA
> Gigantic opportunity for people in Test.
(Did this happen? Personally I saw testing shrink but found a balance)

Nothing worse than using an app that wasn't ready for release. Using paying customers as QA is fairly low.

An intersting video, 11 years old, i feel that what they're saying wasn't particularly new then.

My personal experience is apps in general are becoming really buggy. UX is terrible and systems just not working.
- Car Rental company needed some documents, their email wouldn't accept emails from my address (had to use Yahoo)
- So many apps that even through you're authenticated, require you to enter your details in AGAIN to send feedback or suchlike
- Real time, web sockets or polling based apps just not being able to handle load meaning actions aren't registered for minutes when it should be instant
- App needing to be resinstalled if you update iOS
- Text fields that automatically populate but with wrong data
