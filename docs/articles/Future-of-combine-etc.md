# [Future of Combine, Async/Await, Is SwiftUI Ready, iOS Dev Career Arc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je_VlMQR8v0)

## Future of Combine
- Will `async await` make Combine redundant?
`async await` reduces the need for nested closures
- Combine has a steep learning curve
- `async await` definitely looks like it can do whatever Combine can do
`async await` targets iOS15 (i think now it can be backwards compatible)

Combine: Subscriber Publisher Pattern


## Async/Await 
- Hacking With Swift article is excellent! Swift Concurrency by Example

## New Buttons - 
WWDC2021
using the standard tints means you will get contrast ratios that satisfy accessibility standards
Out of the Box stuff, very useful

## SFSymbols 3 
- iOS15
- Huge Library of Icons
- Are Design/UX aware of these?
- 1st Party Super Charged Icons!!

## WWDC Sample Code
Library of historical code samples from WWDC

##  Is SwiftUI Ready
__Note: video from last year__
You can mix UIKit and SwiftUI
- Yearly release cycle is too slow for something that's not quite ready like SwiftUI

## macOS Content
Encouraging macOS content of which there is currently a drought

## Dependencies
- get rid of dependencies, use sparingly
- many reasons to avoid
- many reasons to use dependencies too
- trade offs

## Well Rounded Dev
- read books
- watch videos ;-)
- don't rely on tutorials (tutorial trap)
- learn to navigate documentation
- Participate in the community
- Step outside your comfort zone
- Code Complexity Curve
-
