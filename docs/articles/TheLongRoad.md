# Career
## Do you have a plan?

# Sacrifice
- We all have 24 hours in a day (bandwidth)
- Sacrifices are easier if it's part of your life rather than just your job

# What is a job, what is a career?
- moving jobs can be a bick step - make sure where you're going
- don't always follow the crowd

#Â Different Roads
- Engineer
- Manager
- Coach

Every new tech can be considered a turn or a junction on your career "Road"

We need to be clear that somethings are a change in career rather than a career progression
It's very common for developer to be pushed into management or architect
- Try not to limit yourself
- Generalist vs. Specialist
- there's room for everyone

# Company Career
- working in big companies
- be careful of being rewarded for non-transferable skills

# Roadmap and Milestones
- 1 job at a time
- NOT! CV Building
- Each job is an investment

Every company has problems
choose which problems you're prepared to deal with

# What should we look for?
- Know what you want
- Never use a recruiter
- he chooses companies where IT is part of the business rather than just a cost center
- Are you looking for *A* job or *THE* job?
- Look for the "metadata"
- Recruitment is a 2 way street

# Job Specs
Designed to filter out the rubbish ones but not to find the best
- look for the metadata
- Use the signals from the JD
- Bonus's are usually a bad signal
- read between the lines of the JDs
- Opinionated JDs make it easier to decide

# Recruitment Process Phases

# Code Submission
Minimum a code review, need feedback
pair programming (if you practice in your company)

## Bad Signs
- brain teasers
Google started the trend but dropped it.
- whiteboarding code
- online tests, outsourced - indicator that they're filtering people for wrong criteria

# Are you on top of your game?

# World is an unfair place

# Own your Career
- One life!
