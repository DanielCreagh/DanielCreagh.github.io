# Summary according to ChatGPT
    The speaker discusses their experience using Swift UI, a tool for building projects for Mac OS, iPad OS, and iOS, to create an app called Orbit. They mention that Swift UI is still in an early stage and there are some things that are still missing or require workarounds, but overall it is a good tool to use. They also emphasize that it is important to consider the specific behaviors of each platform, rather than just writing code once and running it on all platforms. The speaker mentions that custom UI is easy to make with Swift UI, and suggests using it for projects that have a lot of shared code and custom UI, as well as for prototyping and testing ideas. They also discuss some challenges and limitations they encountered while using Swift UI, such as issues with layout and animation, and offer some tips and tricks for working with the tool.

- Conclusion

# State of SwiftUI
- Still in progress at time of recording
- useful for cross platform development

# When to use SwiftUI
- Start with Widget

# Structure
- Decomposing and composing Views
- Useful for creating different screens/structures for different platforms

# Shortcomings
- things missing, like pull to refresh

# SwiftUI and UIKit
- Easy to combine
- `updateUIView` a nice function for telling UIKit that SwiftUI has updated something

# Text Editor
- customising out of the box components

# Custom Picker View
- an example of cusomising out of the box components

# Presentation of Different Sheets
- navigation

# Modal In Presentation
- constraining user, prevent them from dismissing important views
- block the slide down gesture
- in the presenters experiences, it was necessary to use UIKit to achieve this

# Conclusion
- Still early (2021)
- Good time to get started
- All platforms are different
- Things are constantly changing
- Tricky to estimate time
- Some workarounds might be required (like the Modal in Presentation)
- UIKit & AppKit can come in handy
