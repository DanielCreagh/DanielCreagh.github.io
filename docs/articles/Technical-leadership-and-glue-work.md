# [Technical leadership and glue work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KClAPipnKqw)

### Things never quite go to plan

### Glue Work
- Onboarding people
- Noticing blocked
- Reviewing design documents and highlghting the vague bits
* negative space between designs

"Technical Leadership"

Senior before they're Senior
- not always rewarded

### Career Hurt by Glue Work
When to leave the IC track and become EM etc. (Independent Contributor)
(Dont know if i like the IC term)

- Documenting workflows etc.
- Mentorship
- Agreement
- Unblocking

Leads to context switching.
..which leads to not writing as much code as potential

Soft Skills.

Women were volunteering more
Men wouldn't volunteer unless there weren't any women

## Non-Promotable-Work
There is always a bit of this, but it needs to be shared out equally.

## What job do you want to get better at?
Most learning happens on the job.

Seems like the industry thinks once "Engineer" is removed from your job title, your technical skills have disappeared.
"Not Technical Enough"

## Get Useful Title
## Tell The Story
- Saving Artefacts
- Follow the line
- Visibly Successful 

# Learning
- Never waste an opportunity to learn
- 

# Conclusion
- Turned out to be quite negative towards the Glue Work
- Main advice was to stop doing it
