(derp method)

Refactoring of unlimited size
Refactoring a big ball of mud

Mikado name comes from a japanese game of Pick Up Sticks (Mikado means emperor) Pick up the emperor stick if it's not underneath any other stick

1. reach for a goal (pick up Mikado stick)
2. write down what broke (construct the Mikado graph)
3. revert
4. repeat with sticks from step 2

Similar to TDD

Ruthless about increasing iteration speeds creating discrete, manageable chunks of code.
Good for reducing Cognitive Load

# Summary
The Mikado Method is a software development technique that aims to improve the quality of code and reduce the risk of introducing defects during development. It was developed by Ola Ellnestam and Daniel Brolund in 2005, and is named after the Mikado game, in which players remove sticks from a pile without causing the other sticks to move.

In software development, the Mikado Method involves identifying a specific change or improvement that needs to be made in the codebase, and then creating a "path" or sequence of changes that need to be made in order to implement that change. Each change in the path is treated as a separate task, and the developer works on one task at a time, ensuring that the codebase remains in a stable state throughout the process.

If a task proves to be more complex than expected, the developer may "backtrack" to a previous task and make changes there before moving forward again. The idea is to identify the smallest possible change that can be made to the codebase in order to achieve the desired outcome, and then to work incrementally towards that goal.

One of the key benefits of the Mikado Method is that it helps to reduce the risk of introducing defects into the codebase. By working in a structured, incremental way, developers can ensure that each change they make is thoroughly tested and integrated into the codebase before moving on to the next change. This can help to prevent bugs from creeping into the codebase and reduce the likelihood of introducing new defects when making changes in the future.

Overall, the Mikado Method is a useful technique for software developers who want to improve the quality of their code and reduce the risk of introducing defects. By breaking down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable steps, developers can ensure that their codebase remains stable and reliable throughout the development process.
