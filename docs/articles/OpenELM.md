- corenet (Hugging Face)
- ml-explore

Apple trying to keep up. 
Had a lot working in background but now being more open about it

## Hugging Face
Sandbox in browser for LLM

- OpenELM Pretrained Models available
- apple has their own License

OpenELM, new open source model. (Surprising that Apple do anything "open")
They did some really low-key almost subversive stuff before but now it's changed
Efficient Language Models
Smaller models e.g. 270M parameter

### Bias, Risks and Limitations
Apple use public data sets.
Facebook doesn't.
This makes it a lot more difficult for Apple.

CoreNet is open allowing everyone to see how the training algorithm works.
There is speculation that Apple is being more public about their work to help the share price.
Huge repo hences using GitLFS.
USBC is an inverted Lightning Cable.

- Mistral.

Apple coming out guns blazing - WWDC this year should be intense!

Layerwise Scaling
- optimising parameter usage
- optimised for the hardware
Smarter and more flexible.

Open ELM opens up more than usual
RMS Norm
Grouped Query Attention
Layerwise Scaling
OpenELM went through a lot of testing
- real world scenarios
- works even without network

- using Ubuntu
- repetition_penalty
- need a hugging face token
- 1 gig model
- generated such a sad story
