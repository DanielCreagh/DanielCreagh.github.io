# Store Kit (What's New)
[What's new in Store Kit Testing 2022](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10039/)

## XCode 14 updates
- configure in appstore connect
- create and sync the configuration file locally 
* a one way operation, to resync you'll need a new config file
- sync'd files are read only, to change it needs to be done on AppstoreConnect
- switching between configuration files (ergo store environments) can be done in the scheme editor

** Testing can be done on a device **

### Transaction Inspector
- accessible from the debug bar in xcode (the bar immediately below the code)

## Advanced subscription cases
### Refund requests (iOS 15)
- `refundRequestSheet` <-- SwiftUI

### Offer codes
Edit in the subscription configuration file
- these can be observed in the Transaction Inspector

### price increases
- the transactions can be updated with the price increase
- this will send a message to the app (behind the scenes)
- iOS will present a sheet over the app requesting consent for the price increase
- approve and decline are accessible in the transaction inspector

### billing retry and grace period
- errors like expired credit card
- grace period is how long they can use the subscription with a pending error
- all this can be simulated in the Transaction Inspector

## Sandbox Testing
### Users and Access
- streamlined

###Â AppstoreConnect

### StoreKit 2
`async await` capability and Configuration file
#### fetch products
Products have unique identifiers. These can possibly be managed by b/e(cloud). Client sends user details to cloud and cloud decides which products are available. Client then sends the product list to Apple through StoreKit and received details for purchasing
#### Purchase Product
When the user chooses to buy a `product`, we can simply call the purchase method in order to start the purchasing process
#### Listen for updates
Transactions can be in `pending` state, subscriptions can be cancelled from outside of the app too so being able to listen to the subscription status is important.
`Transaction.listener`
#### Giving users access to paid content
`Transaction.currentEntitlements`
#### Refunds
Now available in the app
