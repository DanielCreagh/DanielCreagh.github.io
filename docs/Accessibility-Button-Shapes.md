Button Shapes
---

Button shapes are part of the iOS accessibility system. They can be enabled by: -
1. open settings app in iOS
2. navigate to `Accessibility`
3. navigate to `Display & Text Size`
4. enable `Button Shapes`

Two things are now enabled throughout the OS and also in individual apps that use iOS components.
- underlines on navigation bar
- translucent boxes around button areas

The purpose of these is to make it a bit more clear which items are selected and the behaviour of the items.
